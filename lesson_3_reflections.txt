When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When I am working with other people collaboratively.
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Because doing so, I have the control of what comes in, considering that others are working with me. It’s not always that I’ll want one’s code into my stuff
