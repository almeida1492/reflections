When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When I am working with other people collaboratively.
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Because doing so, I have the control of what comes in, considering that others are working with me. It’s not always that I’ll want one’s code into my stuff
Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
A fork is a copy of the repository inside GitHub. A clone is a copy of a repository inside the personal computer. A branch is a ramification of the git history. Forks and clones have independence from the original repositories and can’t be merged. A branch can be merged and is linked to the master.
